# Development-methodologies-Lab-2

## Description

> This program implements a default circular linked list. This is one of the oldest and one of the most popular data structures. The main feature of linked lists is that adding/deleting elements is far more quick than in built-in arrays/lists because it doesn't need to recreate itself. The more elements it contains, the more difference in working between linked list and array.

## Variant

- First variant of of application implements a linked list based on build-in arrays

- Second variand of the application implements a default circular linked list 

Defining variant formula: number of the gradebook % 4
```
My variant = 1306 % 4 = 2
```

## Instruction

## Conclusion

Tests are very useful because they help to trace the error in our project itself in development stage, although we will spend quite a lot of time creating them (especially if we first create the tests and then the project itself). But nevertheless, the tests are quite convenient, 
so I can say that it was quite a useful practice in writing this kind of tests, because in big companies it is very much appreciated and allows you to save time in the future
